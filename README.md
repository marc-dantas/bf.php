# Brainfuck in PHP

Nice brainfuck interpreter implemented in PHP programming language.

> **NOTE**: This is a joke project just to mess around a bit!

## Getting started
To use the tool, you need to have PHP interpreter installed and then run:

- Mac/UNIX:
  ```console
  $ cd ./path/to/bf.php
  $ php ./src/bf.php
  ```
- Windows
  ```console
  $ cd .\path\to\bf.php
  $ php .\src\bf.php
  ```

You can execute files just passing a file path in the arguments or if you don't provide anything it will enter a very simple REPL that works just like the classic BASIC interactive shell.

Have fun!
